# Genetic Algorithm for Parameter Optimization

This code implements a genetic algorithm to optimize a set of parameters for a simple linear equation. The goal is to find the combination of parameters that minimizes the difference between the calculated value and a target value.

## How it works

1. **Initialization:** A population of individuals (chromosomes) is created, each representing a set of parameters.
2. **Fitness Evaluation:** Each individual's fitness is calculated based on how close its calculated value is to the target value.
3. **Selection:** Parents are selected from the population based on their fitness. Individuals with higher fitness have a greater chance of being selected.
4. **Crossover:** Two parents are combined to create two offspring. This is done by randomly selecting a crossover point and exchanging the genetic material beyond that point between the parents.
5. **Mutation:** Offspring undergo mutation, where their genes (parameters) are randomly altered. This introduces diversity into the population.
6. **Iteration:** Steps 2-5 are repeated for a fixed number of generations.
7. **Result:** The individual with the highest fitness at the end of the process is considered the best solution, and its parameters are returned.

## Usage

1. **Define the target value and features:** Set the `target` variable to the desired value and the `features` list to the input values.
2. **Set algorithm parameters:** Adjust the `mutGene` (mutation rate), `populationSize`, and `generations` variables as needed.
3. **Run the algorithm:** Call the `mutationAlgo` function with the target, features, and algorithm parameters to start the optimization process.
4. **Output:** The algorithm will print the best set of parameters found and the corresponding calculated value. A plot showing the average fitness over generations will also be displayed.

## Example
```python 
target = 44.1 
features = [4, 2, 7, 5, 11, 1] 
mutGene = 0.1 
populationSize = 10 
generations = 150

result = mutationAlgo(target, features, mutGene, populationSize, generations) 
best_y_prime = calcY(result, features) 
print("Best set of parameters:", result) 
print("ùíö‚Ä≤ =", best_y_prime)
```

## Notes

- The code uses the `random`, `matplotlib.pyplot`, and `IPython` libraries. Make sure to install them before running the code.
- You can modify the code to optimize for different equations or fitness functions.
- The algorithm's performance may vary depending on the problem and the chosen parameters. Experiment with different settings to find the best results.
